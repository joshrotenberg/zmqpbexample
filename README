zmqpbexample

This is just a small example of using Protocol Buffers with ZeroMQ in
C++. I'm using another queue-based system with Protocol Buffers and
wanted to play around with ZeroMQ as an alternative without rewriting
everything right away, and figured this example might be useful to
someone else as well.


This example produces a small library for a server class, and a binary
that runs the server and acts as a client, so it is completely self
contained, i.e. running the zmqpbexample is all you need to do to see
it in action. Obviously, the code itself is more interesting than
running it, but this setup makes it easier to test.


Dependencies:

* ZeroMQ - http://www.zeromq.org/
* Protocol Buffers - http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/

Build:

bash$ ./configure
bash$ make

Run:

bash$ ./src/zmqpbexample

Note:

This example might not work with newer versions of protobuf. In that case
you will need to regenerate the protobuf related files and then build.

Regenerating protobuf files:

bash$ protoc -I=protobuf --cpp_out=src/ protobuf/zmqpbexample.proto
